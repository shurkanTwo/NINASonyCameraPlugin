# Sony Camera Plugin

Native NINA plugin for Sony mirrorless/DSLR bodies over the Sony MTP interface, so you can control the camera directly from NINA without ASCOM.

## Features

- Supports many Sony cameras (supported list: https://github.com/dougforpres/ASCOMSonyCameraDriver/wiki/Supported-Cameras)
- Connects Sony bodies and surfaces their model name in NINA
- LiveView streaming (16-bit monochrome, where supported) plus normal captures saved as ARW through NINA's RAW converter so full metadata is preserved
- Gain dropdown populated with actual ISO values (including Auto when present); ISO is controllable via the Gain property
- Battery level reporting; exposes camera pixel size and resolution
- Camera-controlled lenses exposed as a focuser inside NINA (supported lenses: https://github.com/dougforpres/ASCOMSonyCameraDriver/wiki/Supported-Lenses)
- Handles cameras that do not expose ISO options until they are "learned" in-camera

## Requirements

- NINA 3.2 or newer (built against `NINA.Plugin` 3.2.x)
- Windows 10 1809 or newer (.NET 8, WPF)
- Sony body set to PC Remote/MTP mode
- This plugin uses the core (non-ASCOM) files from the Sony ASCOM driver v1.0.1.17 or later; install that driver from https://github.com/dougforpres/ASCOMSonyCameraDriver/releases so the shared components are present.

## Installation

Install via the N.I.N.A. plugin manager or manually download and copy the DLL file into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\NINA\\Plugins\\<Major>.<Minor>.<Hotfix>\\Sony Camera Plugin\\` from:
https://github.com/dougforpres/NINASonyCameraPlugin/releases

## Usage notes

- ISO/gain list may be empty until the camera has learned ISO options; set an ISO on-camera once if needed.
- Temperature is not reported (the plugin does not request processed ARW metadata).
- Binning and sub-sampling are not supported; captures use the full sensor frame.
- For exposures <= 30s the driver chooses the nearest built-in shutter speed; longer exposures fall back to Bulb.
- To keep a copy on the camera's memory card as well as sending it to NINA, use the camera's **PC Remote Settings → Still Img. Save Dest. → PC+Camera** setting (see below).
- Powering off/unplugging the camera while connected can crash NINA via Windows' MTP stack (PortableDeviceApi.dll access violation); disconnect in NINA first to avoid it.

## Keeping copies on the camera's memory card

Saving to both NINA and the camera's memory card is controlled by the camera. Configure these settings before connecting the camera in NINA:

1. Insert a writable memory card and open the camera's **PC Remote Settings**.
2. Set **Still Img. Save Dest.** to **PC+Camera**. **PC Only** sends the image to the computer without retaining a copy on the card.
3. If the camera offers **RAW+J PC Save Img**, choose **RAW** or **RAW & JPEG** so NINA receives the RAW image.

Menu locations and labels vary by Sony model; consult your camera's manual if these options are elsewhere. For an example, see Sony's [Still Img. Save Dest. help page for the A7 III](https://helpguide.sony.net/ilc/1720/v1/en/contents/TP0001661953.html). The camera's choice controls the copy on the card, while NINA's image-saving settings control the copy on the computer.
